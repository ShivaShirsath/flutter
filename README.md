### Windows
+ **Install**
  Open cmd / camandLine 
  ```cmd
  cd C:\src
  git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable
  ```
+ **Update your path**
  If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment   variable:

  - From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select *Edit* **Environment Variables** for your account.
  - Under **User variables** check if there is an entry called **Path**:
    + If the entry exists, append the full path to `flutter\bin` using `;` as a separator from existing values.
    + If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to `flutter\bin` as its value.

  You have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.
  
+ **Enable desktop support**
  At the command line, perform the following command to enable Win32 desktop support:

```cmd
 flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
 ```
